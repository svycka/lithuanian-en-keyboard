# Lithuanian - EN Keyboard

## Lithuanian keyboard layout for Mac OSX

This project was initiated as an alternative keyboard layout for those who have experience working with Lithuanian layout in Windows/Linux.

Switching between US and Lithuanian keyboards is pain. Especially when you need to type numbers, etc.
The layout works by changing the upper row (numbers) with the Alt+numbers to write numbers or Alt+Shift+numbers to write symbols.

## Installation

Double-click on the `Lithuanian.bundle` and follow the instructions.
